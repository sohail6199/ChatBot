# ChatBot
This repository contains the code for a chatbot that utilizes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
The chatbot is designed to provide a conversational interface for users to interact with and obtain information or perform tasks. 
It can be integrated into web applications or websites to enhance user experience and provide automated support.

# Usage
Once the chatbot is set up and running, you can interact with it by typing messages in the chat input field. The chatbot will process your input and respond accordingly. You can ask questions, provide commands, or engage in a conversation.

For example:

User: "What's the weather like today?"
Chatbot: "The current weather is sunny with a temperature of 25Â°C."

User: "Tell me a joke!"
Chatbot: "Why don't scientists trust atoms? Because they make up everything!"

User: "Book a flight from London to New York on June 20th."
Chatbot: "I found several flights available. Here are the options: [Flight details]."

Note:If there is a problem in chatbot it might be due to openai api expiring
